# ADR 0001 — Storage and state architecture for 100x scale

- **Status:** accepted 2026-09-24
- **Decided by:** Codex (gpt-6-astra, reasoning high), on the operator's instruction that Codex makes
  the architecture decisions and Claude implements them.
- **Brief:** measured state on 2026-09-24 — manifest/ 2.0 GB JSONL + registry/ 522 MB YAML tracked in
  git, .git 28 GB, ~400 automated commits/week, raw/ 738 GB local; target 100x (~160M docs).

## Operator resolutions (2026-09-24)

The decision below assumes managed infrastructure; the operator resolved the cost/irreversible
choices as follows, and these override the record where they differ:

1. **PostgreSQL runs in local docker** on the corpus host, with continuous WAL archiving to the
   backup SSD. No synchronous standby until a second host exists.
2. **Payload bytes stay local for now** in the content-addressed pack layout, behind an
   S3-compatible interface, so moving to object storage later is a configuration change. No
   provider is chosen yet.
3. **Git history rewrite is pre-approved for stage 6**, after the migration is verified: archive
   the full history as a checksummed bundle in two places, then rewrite and force-push.

---

**Decision:** PostgreSQL owns operational state; private object storage owns payloads; immutable Parquet exports publish provenance. Git owns code and policy.

The current bottleneck is architectural: whole-corpus lists and dedup sets, shard rewrites, per-round state copies, and full corpus verification. Replacing YAML alone cannot solve it.

## 1. Source of truth: PostgreSQL

Use one PostgreSQL primary with a synchronous standby. Create typed tables for documents, fetch attempts, artifacts, eligibility applications, prune decisions, blocklist keys, backend cursors, runs, and publication outbox. Use JSONB only for variable metrics and source-specific metadata.

Keep immutable provenance revisions plus indexed current-state projections. Record old/new hashes on upstream drift; pruning changes membership and appends a reason rather than deleting provenance. Every committed generation records code, policy, extractor, and cleaner versions.

Hash-partition document tables by document ID into 64 partitions initially; partition exact-key tables by key digest. Unique constraints must include partition keys. [PostgreSQL partitioning](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/ddl-partitioning.html)

- **Reject SQLite as authority:** suitable locally, but shared failover and cross-machine coordination would require additional machinery.
- **Reject DuckDB:** use for export analysis, not operational coordination.
- **Reject Parquet/Delta/Iceberg/Lance as authority:** indexed transactional lookups dominate this workload.
- **Reject JSONL plus compaction:** would recreate database indexing, transactions, and recovery.

## 2. Git: control plane only

Keep code, tests, schema migrations, dependency locks, documentation, bounded curated seeds, backend/vendor configuration, eligibility policy, explicit cleaning policy, and `dataset.lock.json`.

Remove machine-generated registry entries, manifests, prune ledger, blocklist, and cursor values. Separate configured backend pauses from runtime exhaustion state.

Stop per-round Git commits and README rewrites. Rounds commit database generations; the six-hour maintainer commits the publication pointer and corresponding summary, alongside reviewed code/policy changes.

**Reject Git LFS, additional shards, and less frequent bulk commits:** all retain dataset growth inside repository infrastructure.

## 3. Publication: immutable Parquet on public S3

Publish metadata-only releases every six hours through the maintainer. Each release comprises a weekly compacted checkpoint plus ordered six-hour deltas, including tombstones, provenance revisions, decisions, cursors, and policy/config copies. Use Zstandard-compressed Parquet, targeting 256 MiB files.

Export from committed generation sequences through the transactional outbox. Weekly compaction replays exports independently of growth. Retain all files referenced by published releases.

`dataset.lock.json` contains:

- Dataset UUID, generation, schema version.
- Immutable release descriptor URL and SHA-256.
- Producer code commit and policy/config digests.

The descriptor lists every checkpoint/delta checksum and row count. Publish it last, verify it, then update Git. A failed upload leaves the previous release valid; retry publication without rolling back growth.

Provide a streaming importer and reproduction command. Record unavailable or drifted upstream documents explicitly: metadata cannot guarantee that upstream bytes remain available.

**Reject Hugging Face as canonical storage:** optional discovery mirror only.  
**Reject GitHub Releases:** unsuitable as the primary continuously growing provenance store.

## 4. Concurrency and recovery: fenced generations

Allow one mutating coordinator globally; parallel workers perform bounded tasks.

Replace filesystem ownership with a database lease: heartbeat every 20 seconds, expire after 120 seconds, increment a fencing epoch on takeover. Every mutation verifies the current epoch under transaction locking. Maintain global per-host download limits across workers.

Checkpoint work into run-scoped staging tables using short transactions. Upload immutable artifacts first. After all required gates pass, one transaction applies staged metadata, decisions, exact keys, cursor changes, counters, outbox records, and the new generation pointer.

Readers see only committed generations. Failed rounds leave cursors unchanged; another machine resumes staged work or aborts it idempotently. Late workers cannot publish. Preserve owned-process termination on cancellation.

Maintainer triage reads a settled generation without holding the lease; action reacquires ownership and revalidates it. Authorized operators connect to the shared service; outsiders import a published release into an independent database.

**Reject local `flock` as global coordination:** it cannot fence another machine.  
**Reject a transaction spanning downloads:** excessive lock duration and recovery exposure.

## 5. Payloads and backups: private S3, persistent originals

Keep raw originals long-term for every document ever admitted to a committed corpus. Preserve existing restricted raw/text provenance. Keep verbatim text for inexpensive recleaning; retain cleaned artifacts referenced by retained generations.

Use logical addresses `(stage, SHA-256)` over uncompressed bytes. Physically pack small artifacts into approximately 256 MiB immutable objects with per-artifact offsets, lengths, codecs, and hashes; large artifacts remain standalone. Compress text/corpus with independent Zstandard frames; avoid recompressing PDFs. Hash pack objects too.

Local disks become bounded caches. `corpus/` becomes an explicit materialized subset; full-scale training streams generation membership and packed artifacts. Never infer eligibility from object listings. Use conditional object creation to prevent overwrites. [S3 conditional writes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/conditional-writes.html)

Back up objects incrementally to a separate account and region, with independent deletion protection. Archive PostgreSQL WAL continuously, take daily incremental/weekly full backups, retain 35 days of point-in-time recovery, and test restoration monthly. [PostgreSQL recovery](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/continuous-archiving.html)

Track replication freshness; target disaster loss below 15 minutes. Garbage-collect unreferenced staging/rejected bytes only after 30 days and reference checks.

**Reject SSD tarballs as primary backup:** repeated full copies and round-lock duration cannot scale.  
**Reject deleting accepted raw bytes:** upstream drift would destroy the reproduction anchor.

## 6. Dedup: transactional exact keys, rebuildable LSH

Store indexed URL/title digests, full normalized values for collision verification, document IDs, and artifact hashes in PostgreSQL. Preserve normalization and curated precedence during migration. Query candidate batches; never load all keys into Python.

Store versioned MinHash signatures against body hashes in PostgreSQL: initially 128 × 64-bit values, approximately **164 GB at 160M documents**. Exclude provenance headers; version normalization, shingling, and seed.

Build LSH postings in RocksDB across 256 movable logical shards, using 32 bands of four values. That implies **5.12 billion postings**: budget disk, not RAM. Feed indexes from the outbox; require their generation watermark before dedup-dependent promotion, and compare candidates within the pending batch.

LSH proposes candidates; verify similarity before decisions. Oversized buckets enter deferred comparison rather than silently truncating results. Deploy in shadow mode until multilingual drop/retain evaluation approves thresholds.

**Reject Redis/in-memory LSH:** unnecessary RAM cost and another durability problem.  
**Reject automatic pruning from band collisions:** collisions are evidence, not decisions.

## 7. Migration: independently shippable stages

1. **Introduce interfaces.** Add paginated iteration, batch membership, targeted upserts, explicit tombstones, and artifact resolution behind `registry.py`. Keep file storage authoritative.  
   **Rollback:** select the legacy implementation.

2. **Build PostgreSQL shadow state.** Import a locked settled snapshot while production resumes; capture subsequent successful-round deltas durably and replay idempotently. Compare canonical row hashes, decisions, restrictions, cursors, and counts.  
   **Rollback:** discard/rebuild shadow state.

3. **Convert every production caller.** Include `rotation.py`, `blocklist.py`, direct prune-ledger appends, stats, contracts, and maintainer recovery—not just `registry.py` consumers. Preserve old list/set APIs temporarily for compatibility. Preserve `write_manifest_rows` replacement semantics; never silently reinterpret it as upsert.  
   **Rollback:** retain legacy callers/backend.

4. **Cut over between rounds.** Drain one round, reconcile shadow state, enable PostgreSQL authority and generation promotion. Stop Git-based round snapshots. Keep verified legacy exports for seven days.  
   **Rollback:** fence writers, export the latest committed generation, switch backend; never restore a stale cutover copy.

5. **Move artifacts incrementally.** Upload and verify hashes, prefer object reads with local fallback, then evict replicated local copies. Introduce streaming training and incremental verification.  
   **Rollback:** restore local cache from immutable objects.

6. **Publish and retire bulk Git state.** Verify an independent release import before removing tracked data. Enable LSH separately in shadow mode.  
   **Rollback:** previous valid release/code; disable near-dup decisions.

Acceptance requires existing behavioral tests, adapted storage-layout contracts, byte-identical cleaning, multilingual/table preservation, eligibility exclusion, failure-injection recovery, stale-writer rejection, and successful backup restoration. At 160M synthetic metadata rows, require bounded memory and a 400-document round’s metadata work below 30 seconds p95 on documented hardware. Verify changed artifacts each round; run resumable background integrity sweeps.

Archive the existing history as a checksummed Git bundle in two locations. Then perform one coordinated history rewrite removing bulk data paths and empty automated commits, publish the commit mapping, replace affected refs, and require fresh clones.

## 8. Accepted risks and exclusions

This requires database operations, object-storage funding, export compaction, and index monitoring. Capacity remains an acceptance test, not a promise inferred from engine choice.

No active-active writers, Kubernetes requirement, vector database, corpus bytes in public exports, or cleaning-policy change accompanies this migration. Pausing patents changes backend configuration only.
